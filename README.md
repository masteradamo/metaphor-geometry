scripts for contextually modelling metaphor using dynamic distributional representations

This repository contains four scripts for building a dyanmically contextual distributional semantic model, 
using this model to project subspaces based on metaphoric input, and modelling human metaphor judgements 
based on correlations with these projections:

 - modeller: builds the base model
 - meanmaxer: creates files for reading geometric features
 - geometer: projects subspaces based on metaphoric input
 - scoreer: models human judgemnets based on subspaces
